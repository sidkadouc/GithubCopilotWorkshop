# Copilot Demos for Java developers

![Java Icon with IntelliJ](./images/icon_java.jpg)

This contains a collection of hands on lab for Copilot for Java programming language. This is going to be useful for customers who are interested in using Java development with Copilot.

For Java customers, they are likely to use Ecllipse IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, or even variations of Eclipse like Spring Framework IDE more than Visual Studio Code. Unfortunately, Copilot is not available for Eclipse IDE or its variations. However, you can show IntellI IDEA hands on lab to Java customers or simple Java hands on lab to show how Copilot works in Visual Studio Code.

> GitHub Copilot is only available for VS Code, Visual Studio IDE, NeoVim, and IntelliJ and GitHub Copilot is not available for Jupyter Notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Some of these hands on labs can be done with just VS Code, but some advanced hands on lab are better done using IntelliJ IDEA.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [IntellI IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [GitHub Copilot Extension for IntellJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot) or [VS Code Extension for Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)

[See this documentation on how to install Copilot extension for IntelliJ](/CopilotExtension4IntelliJ)
